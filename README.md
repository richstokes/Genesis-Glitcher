# Genesis-Glitcher
Toy that generates interesting, random glitch art by automatically corrupting Sega Genesis (Megadrive) games. It works by injecting random data into the game ROMs. It's not big, and its not clever, but it does produce crazy results which are kind of fun to watch!

&nbsp;

## Use
1. Run `macos-setup.sh` to check your environment
2. Run `start-web-server.sh` to start the local web server
3. Drop game ROMs in the `./roms` directory
4. In a separate terminal, run `genesis-glitcher.sh`

*Tested on MacOS with Firefox.*

See the comments in `genesis-glitcher.sh` for settings you can tweak.
